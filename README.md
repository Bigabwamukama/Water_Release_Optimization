# Optimization of Lake Victoria Water Releases to Minimize Level Rise-Induced Flooding Using NSGA II

<p align="justify">This project aims at optimizing water discharge at the Nalubale and Kira hydropower stations using historical data provided by UEGCL. Three regression models were developed to predict daily discharge from water levels: a feed forward neural network (FFNN), a polynomial regression model, and a random forest regressor. Based on k-fold cross-validation, the random forest regressor demonstrated the best generalization performance and was selected for subsequent analysis.</p>

<p align="justify">After establishing a reliable water level‚Äìdischarge relationship, multi-objective optimization was performed to maximize discharge while keeping water levels within the conservation operational range. This was implemented using the NSGA-II algorithm from the Pymoo library, resulting in Pareto-optimal discharge strategies.</p>
